vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increase some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswing   An October surge in the US dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increaseThe WSJ Dollar index rose for the eighth time in the past 10 trading days hitting a high last seen in the spring It has risen 24 this month China set the value of the yuan at a six-year low Wednesday while currencies in major emerging markets such as Brazil Russia Mexico declined against the dollarThe dollar's strengthening has been accompanied by an increase in long-term bond yields reflecting wagers that the Fed will raise rates as soon as December and an autumn recovery in market inflation expectations fueled by oil-price gains On Wednesday the 10-year US Treasury yield rose by about 002 percentage point to 1778 its highest close since early June while Nymex crude closed above 50 for a third consecutive dayThe increases in the dollar and US bond yields so far have been modest while the prices of riskier assets such as stocks have been largely unaffected The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday rose 1554 points to 1814420But many investors say that continued rises in the dollar and bond yields could complicate the Fed's plans to raise interest rates this year for the second time since the financial crisis by potentially spurring renewed capital outflows from emerging marketsClearly a significant tightening of financial conditions with a strong dollar rally and higher bond yields would be of concern for the Fed said Gemma Wright-Casparius senior portfolio manager of the fixed-income group at the Vanguard GroupA stronger dollar is generally good for the US economy boosting the purchasing power of consumers and businesses while holding down inflationBut a rising dollar also stands to hit US corporate earnings at a time when they already are under pressure and stock valuations are broadly seen as stretched It also threatens to hamstring policy makers efforts to generate modest inflation gainsThis Fed is more market dependent than data dependent said Donald Ellenberger head of multisector strategies at asset-management firm Federated Investors If stocks drop significantly prior to the December meeting he said the Fed is very unlikely to raise ratesFed officials meeting in September laid the groundwork to raise short-term interest rates relatively soon according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon although the officials struggled to reconcile internal divisions over the timing of the next rate moveFederal-fund futures on Wednesday reflected a 70 probability of a rate increase by the Fed's meeting in December according to data from CME Group The odds were around 50 a month ago and nearly zero soon after the Brexit voteEurodollar futures showed the value of net bets wagering on higher interest rates in the US hit a two-year high of 1255 trillion for the week ended Oct 4 according to data from TD SecuritiesRising-rate expectations are pushing government-bond yields in the developed world higher after a sharp midyear declineThe yield on the 10-year German bund yield has risen back above zero again this month while the 10-year UK gilt yield topped 1 WednesdaySome analysts say the Fed should welcome the rise in bond yields because it reflects higher confidence among investors over the growth and inflation outlookAs a result some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswingThe so-called 10-year break-even rate the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security was 165 percentage point late Wednesday a five-month high according to Tradeweb The figure suggests investors expect annual US inflation of 165 in the next 10 yearsTo be sure few believe inflation is making significant inroads at the moment The Fed's favored inflation measure has been below the central bank's targets for more than four years Skeptics point to continuing challenges such as rising debt and slowing growth in ChinaThe People's Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the dollar-yuan pair at 67258 on Wednesday marking a 024 decline in the yuan from Tuesday's midpoint Wednesday's fixing put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since September 2010The prospect of slowing growth has been driving money moving out of China and causing the value of the Chinese yuan to weaken Analysts say China is unlikely to allow disorderly depreciation in the yuan and that the People's Bank of China is going to intervene on signs of chaotic yuan movesEric Stein co-director of global income at asset management firm Eaton Vance Management said markets seem far less sensitive to the yuan's weakness this time than they were in the market declines of August 2015 and January 2016I don't think a weaker yuan per se will stop the Fed in its tracks he said But if financial conditions broadly tighten that could stop the Fed from hiking or least force them to emphasize they don't expect long-term rates to rise sharplySaumya Vaishampayan

and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies   Federal Reserve officials are warning investors and foreign central bankers to brace for market turbulence as the Fed prepares to raise short-term interest rates next yearIn a speech to central bankers Friday in Paris Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said rate increases when they materialize in advanced economies could lead to some heightened financial volatility New York Fed President William Dudley at the same conference issued a more detailed alertThis shift in policy will undoubtedly be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence he said of future rate increases in the US Moreover it could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies that have been the beneficiaries of large capital inflows in recent yearsThey offered their warnings as the Labor Department released new data showing the US job market is improving faster than the Fed expects The unemployment rate at 58 in October was below the 63 to 66 range the Fed projected last December for the end of 2014 In September the Fed revised that projection to 5960 still higher than the October rateOther metrics being watched closely by the Fed showed continued gains For instance the percentage of the US population that is employed rose to 592 its highest level since July 2009 This employment-to-population ratio increased one percentage point from a year earlier its largest one-year gain since March 1995The Fed is eyeing rate increases as unemployment declines and slack in the economy slowly diminishes Higher rates will be aimed at preventing the economy from overheatingMany officials believe they will raise their benchmark federal funds rate from near zero by the middle of next year Though the job market is improving more quickly than they expected many inflation measures remain below the Fed's 2 goal which has given them comfort that overheating isn't now a threat and they don't need to rush raising ratesIf all goes according to our forecast and the US economy continues to make progress towards the Fed's dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation the Federal Reserve will likely begin to raise its federal funds rate target off the zero lower bound sometime next year Mr Dudley saidThe Fed's initial moves away from easy money have already caused spasms in markets Last year as then-Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about winding down the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program global stock prices fell interest rates rose and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies Early this year as the Fed started pulling back the program emerging-market stocks and currencies were knocked lower Then in October a week before the Fed ended the program stock markets sold off and then recoveredThe Fed's planned move away from low rates is a sign of stronger health in the world's largest economy good news in the US and abroad Officials see market volatility as inevitable when they start to raise rates After years of assuring the public about low interest rates a rate shift in the world's largest economy will lead to new uncertainties about how quickly the Fed will move and how far Higher interest rates tend push down stock prices and redirect investment flows that can jar currenciesStill with their latest warnings Fed officials are trying to minimize the upheaval by talking about it now many months before they expect to moveMany emerging market central banks have been preparing for this moment For instance the Central Bank of Brazil has raised rates from 725 last year to 1125 to stave off inflation and stabilize the Brazilian currency Other emerging-market central banks such as the Reserve Bank of India have taken similar pathsThe watchword among many global central bankers at the Paris conference and others of late has been that they need to focus on domestic

vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increase some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswing   An October surge in the US dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increaseThe WSJ Dollar index rose for the eighth time in the past 10 trading days hitting a high last seen in the spring It has risen 24 this month China set the value of the yuan at a six-year low Wednesday while currencies in major emerging markets such as Brazil Russia Mexico declined against the dollarThe dollar's strengthening has been accompanied by an increase in long-term bond yields reflecting wagers that the Fed will raise rates as soon as December and an autumn recovery in market inflation expectations fueled by oil-price gains On Wednesday the 10-year US Treasury yield rose by about 002 percentage point to 1778 its highest close since early June while Nymex crude closed above 50 for a third consecutive dayThe increases in the dollar and US bond yields so far have been modest while the prices of riskier assets such as stocks have been largely unaffected The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday rose 1554 points to 1814420But many investors say that continued rises in the dollar and bond yields could complicate the Fed's plans to raise interest rates this year for the second time since the financial crisis by potentially spurring renewed capital outflows from emerging marketsClearly a significant tightening of financial conditions with a strong dollar rally and higher bond yields would be of concern for the Fed said Gemma Wright-Casparius senior portfolio manager of the fixed-income group at the Vanguard GroupA stronger dollar is generally good for the US economy boosting the purchasing power of consumers and businesses while holding down inflationBut a rising dollar also stands to hit US corporate earnings at a time when they already are under pressure and stock valuations are broadly seen as stretched It also threatens to hamstring policy makers efforts to generate modest inflation gainsThis Fed is more market dependent than data dependent said Donald Ellenberger head of multisector strategies at asset-management firm Federated Investors If stocks drop significantly prior to the December meeting he said the Fed is very unlikely to raise ratesFed officials meeting in September laid the groundwork to raise short-term interest rates relatively soon according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon although the officials struggled to reconcile internal divisions over the timing of the next rate moveFederal-fund futures on Wednesday reflected a 70 probability of a rate increase by the Fed's meeting in December according to data from CME Group The odds were around 50 a month ago and nearly zero soon after the Brexit voteEurodollar futures showed the value of net bets wagering on higher interest rates in the US hit a two-year high of 1255 trillion for the week ended Oct 4 according to data from TD SecuritiesRising-rate expectations are pushing government-bond yields in the developed world higher after a sharp midyear declineThe yield on the 10-year German bund yield has risen back above zero again this month while the 10-year UK gilt yield topped 1 WednesdaySome analysts say the Fed should welcome the rise in bond yields because it reflects higher confidence among investors over the growth and inflation outlookAs a result some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswingThe so-called 10-year break-even rate the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security was 165 percentage point late Wednesday a five-month high according to Tradeweb The figure suggests investors expect annual US inflation of 165 in the next 10 yearsTo be sure few believe inflation is making significant inroads at the moment The Fed's favored inflation measure has been below the central bank's targets for more than four years Skeptics point to continuing challenges such as rising debt and slowing growth in ChinaThe People's Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the dollar-yuan pair at 67258 on Wednesday marking a 024 decline in the yuan from Tuesday's midpoint Wednesday's fixing put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since September 2010The prospect of slowing growth has been driving money moving out of China and causing the value of the Chinese yuan to weaken Analysts say China is unlikely to allow disorderly depreciation in the yuan and that the People's Bank of China is going to intervene on signs of chaotic yuan movesEric Stein co-director of global income at asset management firm Eaton Vance Management said markets seem far less sensitive to the yuan's weakness this time than they were in the market declines of August 2015 and January 2016I don't think a weaker yuan per se will stop the Fed in its tracks he said But if financial conditions broadly tighten that could stop the Fed from hiking or least force them to emphasize they don't expect long-term rates to rise sharplySaumya Vaishampayan

year as then-Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about winding down the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program global stock prices fell interest rates rose and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies   Federal Reserve officials are warning investors and foreign central bankers to brace for market turbulence as the Fed prepares to raise short-term interest rates next yearIn a speech to central bankers Friday in Paris Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said rate increases when they materialize in advanced economies could lead to some heightened financial volatility New York Fed President William Dudley at the same conference issued a more detailed alertThis shift in policy will undoubtedly be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence he said of future rate increases in the US Moreover it could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies that have been the beneficiaries of large capital inflows in recent yearsThey offered their warnings as the Labor Department released new data showing the US job market is improving faster than the Fed expects The unemployment rate at 58 in October was below the 63 to 66 range the Fed projected last December for the end of 2014 In September the Fed revised that projection to 5960 still higher than the October rateOther metrics being watched closely by the Fed showed continued gains For instance the percentage of the US population that is employed rose to 592 its highest level since July 2009 This employment-to-population ratio increased one percentage point from a year earlier its largest one-year gain since March 1995The Fed is eyeing rate increases as unemployment declines and slack in the economy slowly diminishes Higher rates will be aimed at preventing the economy from overheatingMany officials believe they will raise their benchmark federal funds rate from near zero by the middle of next year Though the job market is improving more quickly than they expected many inflation measures remain below the Fed's 2 goal which has given them comfort that overheating isn't now a threat and they don't need to rush raising ratesIf all goes according to our forecast and the US economy continues to make progress towards the Fed's dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation the Federal Reserve will likely begin to raise its federal funds rate target off the zero lower bound sometime next year Mr Dudley saidThe Fed's initial moves away from easy money have already caused spasms in markets Last year as then-Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about winding down the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program global stock prices fell interest rates rose and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies Early this year as the Fed started pulling back the program emerging-market stocks and currencies were knocked lower Then in October a week before the Fed ended the program stock markets sold off and then recoveredThe Fed's planned move away from low rates is a sign of stronger health in the world's largest economy good news in the US and abroad Officials see market volatility as inevitable when they start to raise rates After years of assuring the public about low interest rates a rate shift in the world's largest economy will lead to new uncertainties about how quickly the Fed will move and how far Higher interest rates tend push down stock prices and redirect investment flows that can jar currenciesStill with their latest warnings Fed officials are trying to minimize the upheaval by talking about it now many months before they expect to moveMany emerging market central banks have been preparing for this moment For instance the Central Bank of Brazil has raised rates from 725 last year to 1125 to stave off inflation and stabilize the Brazilian currency Other emerging-market central banks such as the Reserve Bank of India have taken similar pathsThe watchword among many global central bankers at the Paris conference and others of late has been that they need to focus on domestic problems and prepare for international turbulenceIn this highly connected world you would be kindest to your neighbors when your keep your own house in order said Malaysian central banker Zeti Akhtar Aziz at a Bank of France

concerns over financial markets vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increase some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswing   An October surge in the US dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increaseThe WSJ Dollar index rose for the eighth time in the past 10 trading days hitting a high last seen in the spring It has risen 24 this month China set the value of the yuan at a six-year low Wednesday while currencies in major emerging markets such as Brazil Russia Mexico declined against the dollarThe dollar's strengthening has been accompanied by an increase in long-term bond yields reflecting wagers that the Fed will raise rates as soon as December and an autumn recovery in market inflation expectations fueled by oil-price gains On Wednesday the 10-year US Treasury yield rose by about 002 percentage point to 1778 its highest close since early June while Nymex crude closed above 50 for a third consecutive dayThe increases in the dollar and US bond yields so far have been modest while the prices of riskier assets such as stocks have been largely unaffected The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday rose 1554 points to 1814420But many investors say that continued rises in the dollar and bond yields could complicate the Fed's plans to raise interest rates this year for the second time since the financial crisis by potentially spurring renewed capital outflows from emerging marketsClearly a significant tightening of financial conditions with a strong dollar rally and higher bond yields would be of concern for the Fed said Gemma Wright-Casparius senior portfolio manager of the fixed-income group at the Vanguard GroupA stronger dollar is generally good for the US economy boosting the purchasing power of consumers and businesses while holding down inflationBut a rising dollar also stands to hit US corporate earnings at a time when they already are under pressure and stock valuations are broadly seen as stretched It also threatens to hamstring policy makers efforts to generate modest inflation gainsThis Fed is more market dependent than data dependent said Donald Ellenberger head of multisector strategies at asset-management firm Federated Investors If stocks drop significantly prior to the December meeting he said the Fed is very unlikely to raise ratesFed officials meeting in September laid the groundwork to raise short-term interest rates relatively soon according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon although the officials struggled to reconcile internal divisions over the timing of the next rate moveFederal-fund futures on Wednesday reflected a 70 probability of a rate increase by the Fed's meeting in December according to data from CME Group The odds were around 50 a month ago and nearly zero soon after the Brexit voteEurodollar futures showed the value of net bets wagering on higher interest rates in the US hit a two-year high of 1255 trillion for the week ended Oct 4 according to data from TD SecuritiesRising-rate expectations are pushing government-bond yields in the developed world higher after a sharp midyear declineThe yield on the 10-year German bund yield has risen back above zero again this month while the 10-year UK gilt yield topped 1 WednesdaySome analysts say the Fed should welcome the rise in bond yields because it reflects higher confidence among investors over the growth and inflation outlookAs a result some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswingThe so-called 10-year break-even rate the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security was 165 percentage point late Wednesday a five-month high according to Tradeweb The figure suggests investors expect annual US inflation of 165 in the next 10 yearsTo be sure few believe inflation is making significant inroads at the moment The Fed's favored inflation measure has been below the central bank's targets for more than four years Skeptics point to continuing challenges such as rising debt and slowing growth in ChinaThe People's Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the dollar-yuan pair at 67258 on Wednesday marking a 024 decline in the yuan from Tuesday's midpoint Wednesday's fixing put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since September 2010The prospect of slowing growth has been driving money moving out of China and causing the value of the Chinese yuan to weaken Analysts say China is unlikely to allow disorderly depreciation in the yuan and that the People's Bank of China is going to intervene on signs of chaotic yuan movesEric Stein co-director of global income at asset management firm Eaton Vance Management said markets seem far less sensitive to the yuan's weakness this time than they were in the market declines of August 2015 and January 2016I don't think a weaker yuan per se will stop the Fed in its tracks he said But if financial conditions broadly tighten that could stop the Fed from hiking or least force them to emphasize they don't expect long-term rates to rise sharplySaumya Vaishampayan contributed to this articleWrite to Min Zeng at minzeng wsjcomRelated Heard on the Street Election Is Biggest Rate-Rise Wild Card Fed Decision on Rates Was Seen As

Jump on Softening Landing Last year as then-Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about winding down the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program global stock prices fell interest rates rose and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies   Federal Reserve officials are warning investors and foreign central bankers to brace for market turbulence as the Fed prepares to raise short-term interest rates next yearIn a speech to central bankers Friday in Paris Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said rate increases when they materialize in advanced economies could lead to some heightened financial volatility New York Fed President William Dudley at the same conference issued a more detailed alertThis shift in policy will undoubtedly be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence he said of future rate increases in the US Moreover it could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies that have been the beneficiaries of large capital inflows in recent yearsThey offered their warnings as the Labor Department released new data showing the US job market is improving faster than the Fed expects The unemployment rate at 58 in October was below the 63 to 66 range the Fed projected last December for the end of 2014 In September the Fed revised that projection to 5960 still higher than the October rateOther metrics being watched closely by the Fed showed continued gains For instance the percentage of the US population that is employed rose to 592 its highest level since July 2009 This employment-to-population ratio increased one percentage point from a year earlier its largest one-year gain since March 1995The Fed is eyeing rate increases as unemployment declines and slack in the economy slowly diminishes Higher rates will be aimed at preventing the economy from overheatingMany officials believe they will raise their benchmark federal funds rate from near zero by the middle of next year Though the job market is improving more quickly than they expected many inflation measures remain below the Fed's 2 goal which has given them comfort that overheating isn't now a threat and they don't need to rush raising ratesIf all goes according to our forecast and the US economy continues to make progress towards the Fed's dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation the Federal Reserve will likely begin to raise its federal funds rate target off the zero lower bound sometime next year Mr Dudley saidThe Fed's initial moves away from easy money have already caused spasms in markets Last year as then-Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about winding down the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program global stock prices fell interest rates rose and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies Early this year as the Fed started pulling back the program emerging-market stocks and currencies were knocked lower Then in October a week before the Fed ended the program stock markets sold off and then recoveredThe Fed's planned move away from low rates is a sign of stronger health in the world's largest economy good news in the US and abroad Officials see market volatility as inevitable when they start to raise rates After years of assuring the public about low interest rates a rate shift in the world's largest economy will lead to new uncertainties about how quickly the Fed will move and how far Higher interest rates tend push down stock prices and redirect investment flows that can jar currenciesStill with their latest warnings Fed officials are trying to minimize the upheaval by talking about it now many months before they expect to moveMany emerging market central banks have been preparing for this moment For instance the Central Bank of Brazil has raised rates from 725 last year to 1125 to stave off inflation and stabilize the Brazilian currency Other emerging-market central banks such as the Reserve Bank of India have taken similar pathsThe watchword among many global central bankers at the Paris conference and others of late has been that they need to focus on domestic problems and prepare for international turbulenceIn this highly connected world you would be kindest to your neighbors when your keep your own house in order said Malaysian central banker Zeti Akhtar Aziz at a
