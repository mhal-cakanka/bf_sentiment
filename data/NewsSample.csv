"1828023818","Fed Rate-Rise Plan Hits Snag in Stronger Dollar Higher Long-Term Yields An October surge in the US dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increase some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswing   An October surge in the US dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increaseThe WSJ Dollar index rose for the eighth time in the past 10 trading days hitting a high last seen in the spring It has risen 24 this month China set the value of the yuan at a six-year low Wednesday while currencies in major emerging markets such as Brazil Russia Mexico declined against the dollarThe dollar's strengthening has been accompanied by an increase in long-term bond yields reflecting wagers that the Fed will raise rates as soon as December and an autumn recovery in market inflation expectations fueled by oil-price gains On Wednesday the 10-year US Treasury yield rose by about 002 percentage point to 1778 its highest close since early June while Nymex crude closed above 50 for a third consecutive dayThe increases in the dollar and US bond yields so far have been modest while the prices of riskier assets such as stocks have been largely unaffected The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday rose 1554 points to 1814420But many investors say that continued rises in the dollar and bond yields could complicate the Fed's plans to raise interest rates this year for the second time since the financial crisis by potentially spurring renewed capital outflows from emerging marketsClearly a significant tightening of financial conditions with a strong dollar rally and higher bond yields would be of concern for the Fed said Gemma Wright-Casparius senior portfolio manager of the fixed-income group at the Vanguard GroupA stronger dollar is generally good for the US economy boosting the purchasing power of consumers and businesses while holding down inflationBut a rising dollar also stands to hit US corporate earnings at a time when they already are under pressure and stock valuations are broadly seen as stretched It also threatens to hamstring policy makers efforts to generate modest inflation gainsThis Fed is more market dependent than data dependent said Donald Ellenberger head of multisector strategies at asset-management firm Federated Investors If stocks drop significantly prior to the December meeting he said the Fed is very unlikely to raise ratesFed officials meeting in September laid the groundwork to raise short-term interest rates relatively soon according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon although the officials struggled to reconcile internal divisions over the timing of the next rate moveFederal-fund futures on Wednesday reflected a 70 probability of a rate increase by the Fed's meeting in December according to data from CME Group The odds were around 50 a month ago and nearly zero soon after the Brexit voteEurodollar futures showed the value of net bets wagering on higher interest rates in the US hit a two-year high of 1255 trillion for the week ended Oct 4 according to data from TD SecuritiesRising-rate expectations are pushing government-bond yields in the developed world higher after a sharp midyear declineThe yield on the 10-year German bund yield has risen back above zero again this month while the 10-year UK gilt yield topped 1 WednesdaySome analysts say the Fed should welcome the rise in bond yields because it reflects higher confidence among investors over the growth and inflation outlookAs a result some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswingThe so-called 10-year break-even rate the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security was 165 percentage point late Wednesday a five-month high according to Tradeweb The figure suggests investors expect annual US inflation of 165 in the next 10 yearsTo be sure few believe inflation is making significant inroads at the moment The Fed's favored inflation measure has been below the central bank's targets for more than four years Skeptics point to continuing challenges such as rising debt and slowing growth in ChinaThe People's Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the dollar-yuan pair at 67258 on Wednesday marking a 024 decline in the yuan from Tuesday's midpoint Wednesday's fixing put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since September 2010The prospect of slowing growth has been driving money moving out of China and causing the value of the Chinese yuan to weaken Analysts say China is unlikely to allow disorderly depreciation in the yuan and that the People's Bank of China is going to intervene on signs of chaotic yuan movesEric Stein co-director of global income at asset management firm Eaton Vance Management said markets seem far less sensitive to the yuan's weakness this time than they were in the market declines of August 2015 and January 2016I don't think a weaker yuan per se will stop the Fed in its tracks he said But if financial conditions broadly tighten that could stop the Fed from hiking or least force them to emphasize they don't expect long-term rates to rise sharplySaumya Vaishampayan contributed to this articleWrite to Min Zeng at minzeng

"1621442701","Fed to Markets Brace for Volatility Ahead of Rate Rise Yellen and Dudley Get Jump on Softening Landing Last year as then-Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about winding down the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program global stock prices fell interest rates rose and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies   Federal Reserve officials are warning investors and foreign central bankers to brace for market turbulence as the Fed prepares to raise short-term interest rates next yearIn a speech to central bankers Friday in Paris Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said rate increases when they materialize in advanced economies could lead to some heightened financial volatility New York Fed President William Dudley at the same conference issued a more detailed alertThis shift in policy will undoubtedly be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence he said of future rate increases in the US Moreover it could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies that have been the beneficiaries of large capital inflows in recent yearsThey offered their warnings as the Labor Department released new data showing the US job market is improving faster than the Fed expects The unemployment rate at 58 in October was below the 63 to 66 range the Fed projected last December for the end of 2014 In September the Fed revised that projection to 5960 still higher than the October rateOther metrics being watched closely by the Fed showed continued gains For instance the percentage of the US population that is employed rose to 592 its highest level since July 2009 This employment-to-population ratio increased one percentage point from a year earlier its largest one-year gain since March 1995The Fed is eyeing rate increases as unemployment declines and slack in the economy slowly diminishes Higher rates will be aimed at preventing the economy from overheatingMany officials believe they will raise their benchmark federal funds rate from near zero by the middle of next year Though the job market is improving more quickly than they expected many inflation measures remain below the Fed's 2 goal which has given them comfort that overheating isn't now a threat and they don't need to rush raising ratesIf all goes according to our forecast and the US economy continues to make progress towards the Fed's dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation the Federal Reserve will likely begin to raise its federal funds rate target off the zero lower bound sometime next year Mr Dudley saidThe Fed's initial moves away from easy money have already caused spasms in markets Last year as then-Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about winding down the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program global stock prices fell interest rates rose and emerging-market economies experienced outflows of capital that weakened their currencies Early this year as the Fed started pulling back the program emerging-market stocks and currencies were knocked lower Then in October a week before the Fed ended the program stock markets sold off and then recoveredThe Fed's planned move away from low rates is a sign of stronger health in the world's largest economy good news in the US and abroad Officials see market volatility as inevitable when they start to raise rates After years of assuring the public about low interest rates a rate shift in the world's largest economy will lead to new uncertainties about how quickly the Fed will move and how far Higher interest rates tend push down stock prices and redirect investment flows that can jar currenciesStill with their latest warnings Fed officials are trying to minimize the upheaval by talking about it now many months before they expect to moveMany emerging market central banks have been preparing for this moment For instance the Central Bank of Brazil has raised rates from 725 last year to 1125 to stave off inflation and stabilize the Brazilian currency Other emerging-market central banks such as the Reserve Bank of India have taken similar pathsThe watchword among many global central bankers at the Paris conference and others of late has been that they need to focus on domestic problems and prepare for international turbulenceIn this highly connected world you would be kindest to your

"1650376826","BP Posts Quarterly Loss Amid Oil Price Rout Oil Major Will Cut Capital and Exploratory Budget by Nearly 20 At least two dozen US independent oil producers have announced plans to curb capital spending this year by nearly 24 billion dollars compared with last year's budgets according to a review of company records by The Wall Street Journal   LONDONBP PLC on Tuesday joined a raft of oil companies big and small slashing their budgets for finding and tapping new sources of crude offering a pessimistic outlook on a day it reported a net loss for the latest financial quarterThe London-based company which is still facing up to 137 billion in US penalties from its 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill said it would cut its capital and exploratory budget by nearly 20 down to 20 billionThe announcement came as BP became the only so-called super-major oil company in the red in the fourth quarter a 969 million replacement-cost loss caused in part by a more than 3 billion downgrade in the value of some of its reservesBP CEO Bob Dudley gave a darker assessment of the future than his oil rivals have saying US shale production and low oil prices are a structural shift that is forcing him to reset the whole cost base of the companyThe outlook for oil prices is clearly much weaker than anyone anticipated he said I do think we're in for at minimum a year and probably several years of lower pricesBP is the latest producer to grapple with plunging oil prices by cutting capital expenses walking a line between making short-term cost cuts and the need to invest in long-term projects that will produce crude in years to comeAt least two dozen US independent oil producers have announced plans to curb capital spending this year by nearly 24 billion dollars compared with last year's budgets according to a review of company records by The Wall Street Journal Additional cuts are expected over the next several weeks as big shale players including EOG Resources Inc and Anadarko Petroleum Corp outline their 2015 spending strategiesAnd BP's decision follows super-major rivals Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC in slashing planned capital expenses by billions of dollarsThe cutbacks come after years of high spending on giant projects around the globe With oil near 100 a barrel companies competing for access to drill rigs and contractors drove up development costs and sent giant projects over budget in far-flung places like Papua New GuineaNow oil prices are hovering between 50 and 60 a barrel The situation has benefited American consumers who have enjoyed 2 a gallon gasoline for the first time in a decade but it is below the break-even point for many new oil-drilling projectsBP's gloomy quarterly report didn't scare off investors who sent the stock up nearly 4 in London trading TuesdayThe slashed spending by producers has helped fuel the recent oil-price rally with some betting the cuts will bring the global market back into balance Brent the global benchmark and WTI the US price marker have both gained more than 15 since ThursdayBut the risks of pulling back too far on new oil fields were noted by some analysts and investorsBP last year replaced only 62 of the oil and gas it pumped with new reserves and Shell replaced just 26 For both companies that is the lowest amount in a decade according to data from analysts at Oppenheimer Mr Dudley said Tuesday that the replacement ratios are lumpy year to year and the fluctuations aren't a concernYou'll get Brownie points from the stock market for slashing your spending in the short term but in the long term you have to be concerned about your long-term prospects said Ivor Pether a portfolio manager with Royal London Asset Management which owns Shell and BP stockThe spending cuts and a commitment to paying dividends were heartening to investors Mr Pether said but he added that investors must ask how they are protecting the long-term dividend stability which only comes from delivering new projects to replace the ones that run offDevelopment costs are dropping with the oil price Now said Oppenheimer analyst Fadel Gheit would be the time to invest in long-term projects Instead companies facing investor pressure are cutting back when they could invest at low rates on projects that could be lucrative if prices rebound years down the roadMr Dudley said the company is reviewing for a second time a delayed offshore project in the Gulf of Mexico called Mad Dog 2 in an effort to find ways to cut costs The company also struck a deal to partner with Chevron on some Gulf projects that could make them less costly for BP Mr Dudley saidAnother British energy company BG Group PLC said it would cancel or delay projects in 2015 and cut capital spending by roughly a third to about 6 billion to 7 billion after writing down nearly 9 billion in assets and reporting a net loss of 5 billion for the 2014 fourth quarter In the last six months the world has changed said BG Executive Chairman Andrew Gould on a conference call After four years of prices above 100 we're now operating above 50 a barrelShell last week sounded a less bearish note Its chief executive said the company would cut some 15 billion of planned capital spending over the next few years but executives said they were confident that oil prices would rebound in coming years Chevron said last week it would cut capital spending this year by 13 from 2014Since its 2010 Gulf of Mexico explosion and spill BP has faced investor pressure to maintain dividends which Mr Dudley called a financial priority The company has shrunk since the spill selling more than 40 billion in assets to pay for legal and cleanup costs Even as it announced cost cuts Tuesday Mr Dudley said BP would raise its dividendThe asset sales since 2010 reduced BP's production by about 25 between the spill and the end of 2013 but the company said in December that its head count rose over that period BP said it would book a 1 billion restructuring charge as it tries to cut costs through layoffs and other measuresBP also lowered the value of reserves in places such as the North Sea and Angola which it has relied on for some of its highest profit margins in recent yearsFor the full year BP reported a replacement-cost profita figure that strips out inventory changes and is similar to the net income that US companies reportof 807 billion compared with 2361 billion for 2013BP's net loss for the quarter was 441 billion compared with a profit of 104 billion in the same period last year on revenue down 21 at 74 billionNet profit for the year fell to 378 billion from 2345 billion with revenue falling 67 to 35357 billionBP's earnings only capture a portion of the recent oil-price decline since much of it

three-month rolling correlations between bonds and the SP 500 using weekly total returns—price gains plus periodic payments such as dividendsSHARE YOUR THOUGHTSHow are you handling anxiety over market turbulence Join the conversation belowGet an early-morning coronavirus briefing each weekday plus a health-news update Fridays Sign up here As of March 3 roughly halfway through the current selloff period the correlation was minus 084 according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc data That was the lowest since January 2015 indicating a near-perfect match between stock rallies and bond selloffs and vice versa Correlations range from minus 1 to 1 with minus 1 meaning two things move opposite and 1 meaning they move in lockstepBut the inverse moves haven't been automatic in the past week and the rolling correlation rose to minus 064 Thursday Traders and investors said much of the Treasury selloff was driven by balance-sheet concerns at banks that sold Treasurys instead of riskier debt whose prices had fallen more while others cited the unwind of some hedge-fund trades made with borrowed money Even so the disruption of one of the most closely watched relationships in all of markets helped to further dent sentiment some portfolio managers saidAt the same time many investors are taking heart at the exceptional actions by the Fed and the growing awareness in other parts of government that the coronavirus pandemic and related economic and markets challenges require immediate attentionSome traders add that the scale of the selloff may offer some opportunity for the bold to purchase securities at lower prices taking advantage of both the growing public anxiety over the virus outbreak and the apparent malfunction of crucial parts of the financial marketsThe Dow is down more than 21 from its highs last month and much of the selloff has seemed so headlong that it couldn't help but be overdone some investors said After the SP 500 peaked Feb 19 the broad stock index the MSCI AC World ex USA stock index the SP GSCI commodity index and the benchmark Treasury yield all declined for seven consecutive trading days—the first such streak in data going back to May 1995 according to Dow Jones Market DataWhile earnings estimates have begun to fall and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted global economic growth will slow sharply as governments try to contain the virus the scale of the setback is unclearWe're seeing the market with a for-sale sign on it said Brendan Connaughton managing partner at Catalyst Private WealthHe said his firm is researching and considering investing in a number of stocks it considers undervalued Its potential shopping list includes Salesforcecom Inc Johnson Johnson AbbVie Inc and Amazoncom Inc all of which are well off their highs but have outperformed the broader market in 2020As investors look ahead many say their anxiety is heightened because there isn't a good template to evaluate how the epidemic
